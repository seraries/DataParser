# DataParser

This program is a JavaScript application that I created for use by my workplace, PulsePoint, a marketing agency.
It cuts down on the time required to parse marketing metrics from a huge file in JSON format from several hours
when done manually to seconds when done via this application.

It can be accessed on my website at dataparser.richardsonprogramming.com--I recommend watching the video demo (click
the link in the navbar) to understand how it works.
